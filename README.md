Dense Molecular Structures, Turbulence and Star Formation in NGC253 and The Milky Way

The code to reduce data cubes (1a through 1m) )for lines from CO to SiO (sources in Spectral Cubes' readme), calculate dendrograms (2a through 2m) , create size-linewidth for NGC253 and the CMZ (3a through 5a).

Ran in jupyter-lab, python 3.8. All the packages used are listed at the beggining of each notebook.
